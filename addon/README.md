# TileBoard

This is the addon implementation of the TileBoard project. It allows you to only create your configs files and not worry about the application files.

## How to use

* Make sure that you have Home Assistant 0.77 or greater installed as only new authentication system is supported from now on
* Configure a `configFolder` path in configuration tab. This path should be a folder inside `config/www`.
* In the configurated folder add your or yours configs files. Feel free to add a `images` folder to add your own images.
